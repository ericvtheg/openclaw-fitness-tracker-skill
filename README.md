# openclaw-fitness-tracker-skill

An OpenClaw skill plus helper scripts for tracking nutrition (calories and macros) and workouts from plain-text messages.

This repo is designed so the skill is open source, while each user keeps their private logs locally (SQLite in `~/.config/openclaw-fitness-tracker/`).
